# Dan's First MAUI test

This project will contain a very simple MAUI project.

The goal of it is to test:

* Very simple MVVM and DI
* Simple GitHub action workflows for main branch and releasing
* Signing the app
* Making exe only version (if that is possible)

It is worth noting at the moment I am focusing on desktop development. The app may (probably should given it's MAUI) work on other platforms, but I won't have tested it and there won't be any accommodation in the workflows / releases.

This may change in the future, but if it does, it will likely only be to include Android.
